## Business Case
Danny has a deep passion for Japanese cuisine, so at the start of 2021, he took a bold step and opened a charming little restaurant specializing in his three favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. While the restaurant has gathered some basic data from its first few months of operation, he isn’t sure how to leverage it to improve and sustain the business.

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to analyze the data to answer key questions about his customers, particularly their visit patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. By gaining these insights, he hopes to build a stronger connection with his customers and provide a more personalized dining experience for his loyal patrons.

He plans to use these findings to determine whether to expand the existing customer loyalty program. Additionally, he needs assistance in generating basic datasets so his team can easily explore the data without relying on SQL. Due to privacy concerns, Danny has provided a sample of his overall customer data. 

For this case study, Danny has shared three key datasets: 
1. sales: The sales table captures all `customer_id` level purchases with corresponding `order_date` and `product_id` information for when and what menu items were ordered.
2. menu: The menu table maps the `product_id` to the actual `product_name` and `price` of each menu item.
3. members: The members table captures the `join_date` when a `customer_id` joined the beta version of Danny’s Diner loyalty program.
