#### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
- For this question, we will join the `temp_runner_orders` and `pizza_names` tables with the `temp_customer_orders` table to account for cancelled orders and show the pizza name in the output.

```sql
select c.pizza_id, pizza_name, count(c.pizza_id) as number_of_pizzas from temp_customer_orders as c
inner join pizza_names as p on c.pizza_id=p.pizza_id
inner join temp_runner_orders as r on c.order_id=r.order_id
where distance is not null
group by pizza_id, pizza_name;
```

Result:
