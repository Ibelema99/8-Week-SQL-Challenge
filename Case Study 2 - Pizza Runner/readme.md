## Introduction
Did you know that over 115 million kilograms of pizza is consumed daily worldwide??? (Well according to Wikipedia anyway‚Ä¶) 

Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.


## Datasets Used
For this case study, Danny has shared six key datasets: 
1. runners: The `runners` table shows the `registration_date` for each new runner
2. customer_orders: Customer pizza orders are captured in the `customer_orders` table with 1 row for each individual pizza that is part of the order.
   - The `pizza_id` relates to the type of pizza which was ordered, whilst the `exclusions` are the `ingredient_id` values which should be removed from the pizza, and the `extras` are the `ingredient_id` values which need to be added to the pizza.
   - Note that customers can order multiple pizzas in a single order with varying `exclusions` and `extras` values, even if the pizza is the same type!
   - The exclusions and extras columns will need to be cleaned up before using them in your queries (please click [here]() to see how the cleaning was done)
3. runner_orders: After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner; however, not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.
   - The `pickup_time` is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. The `distance` and `duration` fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.
   - There are some known data issues with this table, so click [here]() to see the cleaning.
4. pizza_names: At the moment, Pizza Runner only has 2 pizzas available - the Meat Lovers or the Vegetarian!
   - This table contains `pizza_id` and `pizza_names`
5. pizza_recipes: Each `pizza_id` has a standard set of `toppings` which are used as part of the pizza recipe.
6. pizza_toppings: this table contains all of the `topping_name` values with their corresponding `topping_id` value
